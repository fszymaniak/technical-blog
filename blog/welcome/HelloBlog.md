# Hello... ~~world~~ Blog! 
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...
#### sorry guys, just joking :P 
## Let's start....A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

What the heck is with blogging in 2023, some people said that blogs are dead nowadays, who knows maybe they are right or maybe they are wrong. Let's see...
I know that the starting point is always the hardest part, as human beings we are procrastinating too much, even myself is doing.
Well, we are also thinking that we are not ready yet or it is not as perfectly done as we have thought it would be.
Unfortunately, that causes delays or even forsaking of our ideas.
My goal is to help others in understanding the testing topics some of them are even new to me but I am sure that we can manage with them. 

## Topic ideas 
What this blog will be about? 

| Ideas                     | Details                                                                                                                   |

| Testing Overall           | Basic and advance testing topics, I am learning how to blog and what is the best way to share a knowledge with others. Example topic - [Shift left approach](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-shift-left-testing)      |
| Testing in .NET           | Tesing examples in C#                                                                                                     |

| Unfamiliar testing topics | Like mobile testing in which I am not the expert                                                                          |

Suggestion and constuctive feedback are more then welcome in the comments!

# Conclusion
...
> ship daily 
> done is better then perfect 

are two sentences which I am going to implement in this blog. Maybe daily blogging will be too much but each day I will try to prepare a piece of info for the next post. Quality of content could be different depends on the topic itself but it is a part of the learning path! 

This is the way! 

Thanks you and see you around.
Happy testing to all of you!
